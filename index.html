                            life - you don't really have anything on
                            your mind anymore. You are free. Are you feeling that yet? Well, did we mention you are
                            also
                            free to choose the music you want to listen to? That's your music - your time, after
                            all.
                        </p>
                        <p>Well, free is good, but are you feeling lost now? So much music, so many songs and
                            artists,
                            and no light ahead?

                        <p>You are bound to have at least 1 song you like. Maybe 2? Well, 1 is enough, really.</p>
                        <p>Now you can get recommendations based on that 1 song. Good recommendations. And a lot of
                            them.</p>
                        <p>And if you ever get tired of those recommendations.. try using another song.</p>
