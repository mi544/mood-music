                So this time has come. You finally sorted everything out, no more chores
                or issues in your life - you don't really have anything on your mind
                anymore. You are free. Are you feeling that yet? Well, did we mention you
                are also free to choose the music you want to listen to? That's your music
                - your time, after all.
              </p>
              <p>
                Well, free is good, but are you feeling lost now? So much music, so many
                songs and artists, and no light ahead?
              </p>
              <p>We feel you and we want to help you with that.</p>
              <p>
                You are bound to have at least 1 song you like. Maybe 2? Well, 1 is
                enough, really.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now you can get recommendations based on that 1 song. Good
                recommendations. And a lot of them.
              </p>
              <p>
                And if you ever get tired of those recommendations.. try using another
                song.
              </p>
              <p>We hope you will like it!</p>
